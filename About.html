<h2 align="center"> Who Am I? </h2>
<p  style="text-align:justify"> My name is Tabassum, I am a Software Engineer who has graduated from the University Of Bradford. I am a dedicated, confident and self-motivated individual who understands the importance of developing knowledge and good relationships with customers and colleagues. My motivation to undertake a career in Software Engineering stems from a strong interest in technology and ability to solve complex problems. The nature of my degree programme has given me a good grounding in the fundamentals of software development. I thrive on challenges and feel comfortable working on projects that fall beyond my comfort zone and knowledge set.  </p>
